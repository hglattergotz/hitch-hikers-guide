##  Lack Of Time

You'll have to take it.

Note:
Henning

Unfortunately there are no shortcuts here. Due to the complexity of the subject and
the large number of choices this will take time.
What you might be surprised to hear is that we think you will be spending most of your
time learning about non technical things related to the framework.

HELP: Want to say a bit more about the non-technical things that take time, but also
do not want to give away what you will be talking about in the next section. Any ideas?
