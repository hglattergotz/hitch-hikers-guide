##  The Hype Train

Get off!!!

Note:
Henning

- very tempting to follow along
- fear of being left behind
- twitter, hacker news, etc
- prevents focusing in-depth
- if important will stick around
- take a deep breath and let go

So, not only are there abundant choices, but if you follow the news even just on the
periphery, you will notice that there is a huge amount of noise around many of the
new technologies - also called Hype.
It is very tempting to try and follow all the newest developments because you are
afraid to be left behind. I mean you might miss something important. Our industry is
especially prone to this since it evolves at blistering speeds.
But, if you spend too much time on Twitter or other news sources you will simply
drive yourself mad and burn up a tone of time. And this will prevent you from focusing
on what is actually important. Well, doing your job, for one thing.
So, take a deep breath and just get off the train!
You will not miss anything. The important stuff will bubble up to the top and come to
your attention. And so what if it is a few weeks or months later.
