# Go. All. In.

Go deep.

Note:

Submit to the framework!
Sell all your earthly possessions, dress in a brown robe and move into a barren habitat
that is free from distractions ... oh wait, different religion.

Get a commitment from your team and management to spend the time and effort needed
to get really good at this even if it means things will take longer at first.
Because that will happen!
