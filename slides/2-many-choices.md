- JS moving forward at blistering speed
- staggering number of choices
- but only hand full of leaders

There are so many to choices when it comes to Javascript frameworks. Actually there
are a staggering number of them. What makes it even more difficult is that new shiny
ones are coming onto the scene at an almost ridiculous pace. I mean there are even
jokes about this phenomenon in the JavaScript ecosystem.
So, no one can blame you if your head is spinning and you don't know where to even
begin. You might experience something called choice paralysis.
