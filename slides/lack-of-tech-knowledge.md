##  Lack Of Tech Knowledge

ES6, Transpilers, Minifiers, Reactive Programming, etc...

Not sufficiently understanding the technologies involved in the framework stacks can
be a problem. So, What we mean by this?
We think you need to at least know the landscape to some degree in order to understand
if the technology in questions affects your decision at all and if so, how.
However, it is probably not all that important to know the details of the build tool
chain that comes with some of the frameworks out of the box. You probably do not care
if the build is driven by broccoli or gulp or grunt.
What you will be more important is whether you want to write ES6 code and what you
will need in order to be able to do that.
