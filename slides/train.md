## Train Your Devs

Make them great JavaScript devs and great at working with the framework.
Have a trainings-pipeline so new devs can be productive quickly.

Note:
Henning

There are a number of good training resources for your developers. If there aren't any
on-site classes in your area, there are excellent online classes for free as well as
paid.
In most framework communities there are experts in that framework that offer good
trainings in various locations and online.
Invest in a dev team library and get them paper or ebooks to share, whichever they
prefer.
