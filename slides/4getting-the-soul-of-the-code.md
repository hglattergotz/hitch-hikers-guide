##  4getting The Soul Of The Code

The people.

Frameworks are not mythical beings born in some distant nebula, they are the hard
work of people. Developers like you!
They are part of a community that are most likely interested in helping you. So ask
for help on Slack, Discourse, IRC or whatever channel the framework uses.
In many cases there is very good access directly to the core team members.

HELP: What else to say about this?
