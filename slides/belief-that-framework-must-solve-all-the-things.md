##  Belief That Framework Must Solve All The Things

It's all just JavaScript + software engineering.

Henning -> Kahlil

You need to understand that a framework, any framework, will not solve all your
specific problems. And that is fine.
As long as it makes you more productive and solves the repetitive, mundane and
sometimes hard problems for you it is doing its job.
Chances are that the ecosystem will provide a solution for the more common problems
that are not covered by the framework itself.
